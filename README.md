# Deferred Render Pipeline

A deferred render pipeline using Unity3D's scriptable render pipeline to demonstrate the fundamentals of using deferred shading and using Multiple Render Targets (MRT), for more advanced lighting/shadow techniques see the forward rendering project. This project shares some code with my forward rendering pipline project (https://github.com/akoreman/Forward-Render-Pipeline).

**Currently Implemented:**
- Using MRT to render the geometry buffers in a single pass.
- Sampling from these buffers to calculate diffuse shading from directional lights.
- Renders a screen-space triangle and sample the geometry buffer to a square of that to render the final image.
